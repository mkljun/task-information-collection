		<h3>Welcome to Task Information Collections and thank you for installing it.</h3>

		<p>TIC is a different task/project information management, where you drag your information to the extension page. More information can be found on <a href="https://pim.famnit.upr.si/tic/" target="_new">https://pim.famnit.upr.si/tic/</a></p>
		
		<p>This extension is a part of the research about how project/task collections of information are formed, used and changed over time. We need your help in this study. Your participation will also help further development of the extension.</p>

		<li>
			<span style="font-weight:bold;">Is this extension free to use and what can I do with it?</span>
			<br />
			This extension is free and open source, licensed under the MIT License. You can use it however you like, change it, distribute it, use it in your own software (closed or open sourced), projects, etc. It is provided by the copyright holders and contributors "AS IS". See terms and conditions below.
		</li>
		<br />
		<li>
			<span style="font-weight:bold;">What is happening to my data which is dragged to this extension?</span><br />
			We leave your information (files, email, web pages) intact and the content is never touched or changed or sent to anyone. When files, folders and web pages are dragged over, only paths to them are stored (and some files and folders statistics). All this and additional notes are stored on your computer (in your browser's profile folder). If you participate in the research, your TICs will also backed up on our servers and will be harvested by us. We have no means to access your files from the backup.</li>
		<br />
		<li>
			<span style="font-weight:bold;">How do I participate?</span><br />
			You do not have to do anything other than use the extension. The backup of your will once a week be transferred over a secure and encrypted connection to the server administered by our research team. However, if you do not wish to participate, please select "No" under the "Participate in research" in the properties settings of the extension.
		</li>
		<br />		
		<li>
			<span style="font-weight:bold;">Can my privacy be compromised?</span><br />
			If you participate in the research we do not know who you are. Your id looks something like this: 6d8450ee26bb97157d8ab4fa07fbcf15. Information that you put in the extension and gets transferred to our servers could potentially reveal your identity. Please do not enter sensitive information such us credit card numbers or information of national security. Nevertheless, all your information will be kept strictly private and confidential and NOT shared with anyone but our research team. If you do not participate in the research, all your information is kept on your own computer and we do not have any means to access it.
		</li> 
		<br />
		<li>
			<span style="font-weight:bold;">Is participating in the research safe?</span><br />
			No information will ever be shared with agents or entities outside the research group or used for any purpose other than tool research and development.	We do not know any information other than one you enter in the tool. The data you enter will be transmitted to, and kept on a professionally managed server by our research team at Lancaster University. While data integrity and security will be maintained on a best effort basis, we take no responsibility for data that is accidentally lost or stolen. However, if you do not wish to participate, please select "No" under the "Participate in research" in the properties settings of the extension.
		</li>
		<br />
        <!-- 		<li>
			<span style="font-weight:bold;">Can I get a backup</span><br />
			You can always get your latest back up from our server if you register your user id with a username and password (Describe HOW in the comments). If you do not want to disclose this information and you have your user id (see the Comments tab of the extension). If you want to, we can delete your back up.
