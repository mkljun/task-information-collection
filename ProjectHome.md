TIC is a free Firefox extension that lets you define your projects and drag different information to them: files, folders, web pages, bits of selected text and also emails from web based clients. This creates links to your dragged resources and you can access them quickly via this extension. It also lets you add your own notes, due dates, people and similar tags to information you drag or create.

TIC basically provides different buckets (or think desktops) for projects related fragmented information, lets you understand your projects by finding overlaps through information and provides an overview of collections changes over time. You don't need to learn new organization techniques and it lets you externalize and preserve some additional project knowledge you already have, but it might get lost after a while.
